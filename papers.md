# Suggested Papers

Below is a list of suggested papers from the last couple years of IEEE VIS. All of these can be accessed through IEEE Xplore via ODU. If you are interested in a paper not on this list, contact me for approval first. It must be a full paper, not a short paper.

Suggestion: From just the titles, select 5 papers to download and perform Keshav's 1st pass on.  This will help you to determine an appropriate paper.  If you don't find one that you're interested in from those 5, try another 5, but you don't need to read all of the papers before selecting one.

At the bottom, I have a list of papers that were presented in class in recent years and are off-limits, but I wanted to share them so you could see what students had presented in the past.

*Caveat:* I haven't read all of these yet, but either the title looked interesting or the authors are well-known for excellent papers.
